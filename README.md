# Chromatica Landscapes
> ### *Bless your Mac with Chromatica Aesthetics* üíö
<br>
<br>

Welcome! Thank you for visiting ü•∞<br>
Here you will follow the instructions to decorate your Mac with the beautiful scenes of Chromatica ü™ê<br>
<br>
I made these visuals while creating lyric videos for [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkqzRNWLEZTKkjSAnaGE_HQ). This is one of my best works so far,
<br>so I felt it would be cruel if I didn't share these with the world.
<br>
### I previously shared **the dynamic wallpapers** a while ago, and you can download those [here](https://mega.nz/folder/d8QnBCKD#Ce5nGduSP6CecoNz4-izjg).
<br>You guys loved them so much, so I was really happy üò≠ The designs and aesthetics of this album is superb, and Chromatica will always lie in a special place of my heart. I want to thank Gaga and her team again for sharing this project with us üíï
<br>
### And to celebrate the continued journey with ***Dawn of Chromatica***, I present you...

> ## Chromatica Screen Savers

This is animated, colorful landscape that would catch quite an attraction while you leave your Mac  ü§ì
<br>Made in 4K resolution, this is the best screen saver you can get to show your ‚ú®*inner*‚ú® Chromatica beauty.

It comes in a set of 6 color themes, each titled with matching tracks from the album :
  > *Stupid Love, Rain On Me, Free Woman, 911, Enigma, and Babylon.*

I've designed them considering the balance of light & dark mode, and it will display in rotation based on the time of day!

Chromatica screen saver is powered by **Aerial**. It is a free, open-source software that lets you customize Mac screen saver. It has the best features you can wish for screen saver.  **To use this Chromatica landscape, you must install Aerial first.**

### You can see the preview of screen savers here.

*P.S. Sorry for PC users, I didn't make the Windows version. But I'll post the update here if I find any alternative!*<br>
