# Chromatica Landscapes
> ### *Bless your Mac with Chromatica Aesthetics* 💚
<br>
<br>

Thank you for visiting the page! 🥰<br>
Here you will follow the instructions to decorate your Mac with the beautiful scenes of Chromatica 🪐<br>
<br>
I made these visuals while creating lyric videos in [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkqzRNWLEZTKkjSAnaGE_HQ). This is one of my best works so far,
<br>so I felt it would be cruel if I didn't share these with the world.
<br>
### I previously shared **the dynamic wallpapers** a while ago, and you can download those [here](https://mega.nz/folder/d8QnBCKD#Ce5nGduSP6CecoNz4-izjg).
<br>You guys loved them so much, so I was really happy 😭 The designs and aesthetics of this album is superb, and Chromatica will always lie in a special place of my heart. I want to thank Gaga and her team again for sharing this project with us 💕
<br>
### And to celebrate the continued journey with ***Dawn of Chromatica***, I present you...
